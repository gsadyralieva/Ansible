1.Add 2 new hosts to ansible-server

a.Host1 - CentOS6
b.Host2 - CentOS7

2.Create an inventory file under inventory folder called “newhosts”

a.Create a group called “dev-servers”
b.Add both hosts to this inventory under “dev-servers” group

Ad-Hoc Commsnds:

The following tasks need to be completed using ansible-ad hoc commands:

1.Run ansible ad-hoc command and ensure ansible-server can ping the newly added
hosts
```
# ansible -i inventory/newhosts dev-servers  -m ping
```

2.Run ansible ad-hoc command to find the distribution of newly added hosts
```
#ansible -i inventory/newhosts dev-servers  -m setup -a "filter=ansible_distribution_*"
```

3.Run ansible ad-hoc command to check the free memory of newly added hosts
```
# ansible -i inventory/newhosts dev-servers   -m  shell -a "free -m"
```

4.Run ansible ad-hoc command to check storage available in newly added hosts
```
# ansible -i inventory/newhosts dev-servers   -m  shell -a “df  -h”
```

Playbooks:

1.Write an ansible playbook called “updatehosts.yaml”, this playbook should update all the
packages in newly added hosts. Run the playbook to ensure the hosts are updated.
```
# ansible-playbook -i inventory/newhosts playbooks/updatehosts.yaml
```
2.Write an ansible playbook called “reboothosts.yaml”, this playbook will reboot newly
added ansible hosts. Run the playbook to ensure the hosts are rebooted.
```
# ansible-playbook -i inventory/newhosts playbooks/reboothosts.yaml
```
3.Write an ansible playbook that checks installs apache, starts apache and enables
apache. Run the playbook to ensure apache is installed in both of the newly added
hosts. Hint: you will need to use “when” module here
​```
 # ansible-playbook -i inventory/newhosts playbooks/apache.yaml
```

Clean up 

1.Once the tasks are done, push your code to Github, make sure the inventory folder is
ignored.

2.Share the link to your Github in the group.

3.Delete newly added hosts.
